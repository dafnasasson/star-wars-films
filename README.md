Build and Run instructions below.

This is an app that allows the user to select his favorite STAR WARS movies.
The application componenets includes:

-FilmsCollection:
The component fetches details of STAR WARS movies via the API: swapi.dev and present them to the user.
The user can choose his favorite movies by pressing the "like" button next to each movie 
and to click on the '...' icon to see the full details of the movie. This feature was implemented using 'react-router-dom'.
This componenet also has a FAVORITES button, which allows the user to view his favorite movies and to click on a movie
to access the same page that shows full details of it;
The favorite movies are saved using Local-storage.

-Film:
Displays the main details of each movie and used inside the component: FilmsCollection

-FilmFullContent:

-NavBar:
Displays the main nav bar of the app

-Spinner:
The component is displayed to the user while waiting for information from the api to load.

The app uses:
React, React-router-dom, fetch, promiseAll, Material-Ui, Google-Fonts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
